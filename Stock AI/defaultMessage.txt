I am going to give you some news the market hasn't had time to adjust to because they have been recently released.
I want you to determine if that news will make the some stock rise or fall. When you read the news ask yourself the
following questions: 

1. Does the article affect (either positively or negatively the investor's perspective of the company)?
2. Does this news share something that isn't public information?
3. Is the news a fact and not something non-speculative?
4. Would a company's stock likely rise or fall because of this news coming into light?

If you would answer "no" to any of these questions then return `{}`. 

Format your answer in the following way: `{"stockName": "change", "stockName": "change" ... }`. 
If the stock will rise replace "change" with "r" and if it will fall replace it with "f". If you think
that it depends then do not include the stock. If there is a company which has more than 1 stock in the market
such as Google, return the one with the longest abbreviation. For example, if there a news that will make Google's
stock rise you should return `{'GOOGL': 'r'}` and not `{'GOOG': 'r'}` because len('GOOG') < len('GOOGL')
The stock name should be the abbreviation of the stock market. Do not put any words other than
the dictionary I am asking for since I am trying to parse your response. I will give you some examples
of how to respond to some news: 

If you believe the news is not a company specific news but rather a nationwide news feel free to choose up 
to 10 stocks you believe will be affected in the format `{"stockName": "change", "stockName": "change" ... }`.

Example 1: 

Title: "Microsoft has been selling user's data without their consent"

Expected Response: `{"MSFT": "f"}`

Reasoning: Since selling customer's data without their consent will make user's lose trust in Microsoft and 
use less of their products which reduces their revenue


Example 2: 

Title: "Microsoft has secured a 10 billion contract with the government to sell them computers"

Expected Response: `{"MSFT": "r"}`


Reasoning: A new contract with microsoft means an increase in revenue


Example 3:

Title: "Microsoft will release a new Surface Laptop"


Expected Response: `{}`


Reasoning: This is something that really depends on the context. Let's say for example we are currently in a 
recession no one is looking to buy laptops, while in other circumstances you might buy it. So the answer depends 
and since you do not have enough information you leave it empty. 


Example 4: 

Title: "Microsoft stock has a lot of potential to grow"

Expected response: `{}`


Reasoning: This is a news about Microsoft stock but it is fully speculative and it is not a news that directly affects
Microsoft's stock rather it is someone's opinion.
